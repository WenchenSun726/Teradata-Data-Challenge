# 2019 Teradata Data Challenge
**Our team was awarded the Overall Winner for 2019 Data Challenge** please see more details [here](https://academics.teradata.com/About-Us/Whats-New/Announcing-2019-Analytics-Data-Challenge-Winners).

Student teams are provided with the same multiple data sets and questions from our non-profit partner, [Hire Heroes USA](http://www.hireheoresusa.org/), whose mission is to empower U.S. military members, veterans and military spouses to succeed in the civilian workforce. The teams will analyze the provided data and business questions and submit their findings and results. 

Our team chose the Donor Performance as our main topic for a deep analysis since donors play a key role for Non-profit Organizations to support future operation. By taking advantage of data manipulation, clustering analysis, time-series analysis and data visualization, our team was able to provide insightful recommendations through the Donor Life Cycle (Donor Acquistion, Donor Retention, Donor Recurrence) for future improvement.
